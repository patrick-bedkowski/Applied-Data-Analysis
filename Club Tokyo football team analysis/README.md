<h1>Club Tokyo football team analysis</h1>

<h3>Context</h3>

Congratulations! You have just been hired as a data scientist at [FC Tokyo, a J1 League Japanese professional football club based in Ch≈çfu, Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Tokyo). The company hired you to carry out a variety of data-related tasks, which will be explained in further detail below.

Your manager, Mr. Naoki Ogane, has noticed that an unusually high number of players in your team have birthdays in either April or May, so he asked you to investigate this further -- is this just a coincidence, or are players born in April or May simply better?

<h3>Data</h3>

To answer Mr. Ogane's questions, you will use data from Wikipedia biographies. This is a subset of the Pantheon dataset (1). For tasks 1 to 4, you will use the file `japanese_athletes.csv.gz`. For task 5, you will use the file `all_entities.csv.gz`. Both datasets are`.csv` files with the same columns:

- `id`: a unique identifier per individual.
- `name`: name of the individual.
- `occupation`: the occupation of the individual (for `japanese_athletes.csv.gz`, these are all sports-related).
- `gender`: gender of the athlete.
- `alive`: flag indicating if the athlete was alive in 2020 when the dataset was collected.
- `bplace_country`: the country where the athlete was born  (for `japanese_athletes.csv.gz`, the value here is always 'Japan').
- `birthdate`: the date when the athlete was born.
- `birthyear`: the year when the athlete was born.
- `pageviews`: number of pageviews received by the athlete's page across Wikipedia language editions.
